Description: Ruby bindings for the stomp messaging protocol
 Stomp is a text-oriented wire protocol for messaging (MOM/MQ/JMS)  
 type systems. This library provides two useful interfaces, a low-
 level class, Stomp::Connection, which is a basic protocol  
 implementation, and Stomp::Client, which is designed as a higher  
 level convenience API.
 .
 This package is a dependency package, which depends on the package
 containing actual Ruby stomp libraries for the default Ruby version
 (currently 1.8).
